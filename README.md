### Hi there 👋

I am a front-end developer passionate about accessibility in web applications and websites. Front-end Development is one of the many passions I pursue outside of my day job. Some of my other passions include but are not limited to:

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Front-end development and design.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on an e-Commerce website about cats for fun about buying and selling Cats. No Cats will be harmed in the making or using this product. Coming Soon!
- 🐶 I'm an animal lover primarily Dogs and Cats, but all other animals are super cool too!
- ⚡ I am passionate about retro game design and development. Not so much playing them anymore except select few like '90s to early 2000s style games. Specifically, role-playing games. I love talking about game design and development in general.
